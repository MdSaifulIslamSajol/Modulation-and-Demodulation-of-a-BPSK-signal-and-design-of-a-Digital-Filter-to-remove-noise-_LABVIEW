# Modulation-and-Demodulation-of-a-BPSK-signal-and-design-of-a-Digital-Filter-to-remove-noise-_LABVIEW
 A BPSK modulated signal has to be demodulated and
decoded. At the first step of this assignment the given signal is analysed and the
major frequencies presented in the signal is evaluated. The sample frequency of the signal is 40KHz and the signal is
modulated using a 3KHz carrier signal. 
Another task is to demodulate the signal but before that the noises available in the signal is needed to filter out with a filter. For removing the noise, a digital filter
is designed using theoretical calculations.
